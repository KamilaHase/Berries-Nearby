Berries Nearby

A website dedicated to a community of people who want to help each other out with consumation of fruits and vegetables. There are two main groups of users of this page: people - "farmers" - who own gardens where there has grown too many fruits and vegetables (for short I will be using "fruits" only but it is meant both) and the farmers want to offer these fruits to anyone who is interested. The fruits would otherwise just stay on trees left for birds or just to rott. Second group of website users are people who are interested in self picking these fruits. Together they create a community of people who help each other out - one with offers, other with taking care of the offer. 
The website is closed for public, everybody who wants to join in has to provide basic data and log into the page. The area of gardens and self picking is limited to a specific location, in our case it is the town of Gothenburg in Sweden and its surrounding areas. 
When logged in, every user has the chance to see other people offers and at the same time post an advertisement - offer himself. There is no need to post an advertisement to see the offers.
The website community owners take no responsibility for the physical interaction between the people, although bad behaviour may be reported and some users can be kicked out by the web admin.

This project is fictional only. The idea came from seeing actual people putting small papers of invitation for picking berries and fruits, or simply leaving baskets full of fruits in front of their gardens.

Features to further develop: 
There is a very large number of features that are left to be implemented. The whole app can be much more interactive for all participants.

 - uploading own images of offers - would serve to other users as marketing and real presentation what the actual offer is 
 - expiration date of offers - currently the offers stay there until the user or admin deletes them. There would be a nice option to expire offers if the date has already passed. 
 - time picker - currently the user can pick any time he/she wants no matter what the start and end times are. It would be more user friendly if there is a control function correcting if the time for end is not earlier than time of start of the pick up. 
 - it would be very nice to have a list of already presented offers that has expired or has been "muted" instead of deleted. That way the user can "reactivate" old offers and he/she wouldÂ´t need to add all offer information again. 
- option to be added as "interested" in this offer, therefore added into a group of interested users and be informed on time and clearly about any additional changes of this specific offer 
 
 - chat functions: 
    - chat functions directly among the users could help immensely the entire interaction among them. The input of adding contact and letting people contact themselves is not a perfect solution but serves the current purposes. Good option would be if each farmer who is posting and offer could create a group of people "interested" in his offer and moderate this group such providing information about the amount of fruits left, or adjusting time of pick up. 
    - chat functions among admin and farmer - can moderate if a report has been reported, admin can directly inform farmer what has happened

- notifications: 
    - when a new offer is published
    - when my offer has been reported
    - when I received a new message (after chat functions has been implemented)

- rating of offers
- save (for myself) as favourite offer
