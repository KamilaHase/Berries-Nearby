Berries Nearby

A website dedicated to a community of people who want to help each other out with consumation of fruits and vegetables. There are two main groups of users of this page: people - "farmers" - who own gardens where there has grown too many fruits and vegetables (for short I will be using "fruits" only but it is meant both) and the farmers want to offer these fruits to anyone who is interested. The fruits would otherwise just stay on trees left for birds or just to rott. Second group of website users are people who are interested in self picking these fruits. Together they create a community of people who help each other out - one with offers, other with taking care of the offer. 
The website is closed for public, everybody who wants to join in has to provide basic data and log into the page. The area of gardens and self picking is limited to a specific location, in our case it is the town of Gothenburg in Sweden and its surrounding areas. 
When logged in, every user has the chance to see other people offers and at the same time post an advertisement - offer himself. There is no need to post an advertisement to see the offers.
The website community owners take no responsibility for the physical interaction between the people, although bad behaviour may be reported and some users can be kicked out by the web admin.

This project is fictional only. The idea came from seeing actual people putting small papers of invitation for picking berries and fruits, or simply leaving baskets full of fruits in front of their gardens.
